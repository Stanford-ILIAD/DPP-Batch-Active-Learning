to set up necessary packages.
We provide two notebooks to demonstrate our experiments on the synthetic datasets.

synthetic_documented_1trial.ipynb runs for 1 trial and illustrates how each method selects its training points.
synthetic_documented_100trials.ipynb runs for 100 trials and compiles all test accuracies into a representative boxplot.
